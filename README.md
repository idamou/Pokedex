# Pokedex
This APP uses the PokeAPI to display information about various Pokemon, including their name, image, and type.( https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
 
We used OkHttp Java-based library that provides HTTP and HTTP/2 client functionalities to enable applications to make network requests to web servers using HTTP/HTTPS protocols

We used Glide which is fast and efficient open-source image loading and caching library for Android in the Adapter to load data to the mainActivity

We also used the Class LayoutInflater to instantiate layout XML file to convert it into a View object for the App's user interface.
